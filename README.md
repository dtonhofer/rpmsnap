rpmsnap
=======

## Status

- Maintained. Old but serviceable.

## What is it

A simple set of scripts to compare the contents of [RPM package manager databases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager) of different machines, or of the same machine at different times.

There are three scripts:

<table>

<tr>
<td>rpmsnap.pl</td>
<td>Access the RPM database using the `rpm` command and create a human-readable summary of its contents.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>makesnap.sh</td>
<td>This script runs `rpmsnap.pl`; it should be run regularly from cron to create regular summaries which can 
accumulate in a directory, tagged by creation date.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>rpmsnapcmp.pl</td>
<td>Takes two summaries created by `rpmsnap.pl` and compares the contents, writing out any differences found.</td>
</tr>

</table>

It uses `ssh(1)` to grab a dump of the remote RPM database. 

Suggestion for use if you have several machines
-----------------------------------------------

Suppose you have three machines called 'alpha.example.com', 'bravo.example.com' and 'charlie.example.com'.

On one machine, install a directory tree that looks like this:

    rpm/
    ├── bin/
    │   └── rpmsnapcmp.pl
    ├── data/
    │   ├── alpha.example.com/
    │   ├── bravo.example.com/
    │   └── charlie.example.com/
    └── sbin/
        ├── getHostname_function.sh
        ├── makesnap.sh
        ├── prelinkfix.sh
        └── rpmsnap.pl

Share and synchronize this directory tree among all the machines by putting it on a network file
system or by using a versioning system like svn or git.

Make sure `makesnap.sh` is called regularly (for example, every 2nd day) on all the machines
via cron (not necessarily as root) by a suitable crontab entry.

Then summary files and files listing the errors encountered during generation will accumulate under the
hostname-specific directories. `makesnap.sh` makes sure that a new summary is only kept 
if there are changes relative to the previous summary.

In case of a network file system, sharing is immediate. In case of a versioning system, you have to 
synchronize the filetree from time to time among the machines.

Then the tree may look like this after some time:

    rpm/
    ├── bin
    │   └── rpmsnapcmp.pl
    ├── data
    │   ├── alpha.example.com
    │   │   ├── rpmsnap.2012-10-04_17:00:01.err
    │   │   ├── rpmsnap.2012-10-04_17:00:01.txt
    │   │   ├── rpmsnap.2012-12-04_17:00:01.err
    │   │   └── rpmsnap.2012-12-04_17:00:01.txt
    │   ├── bravo.example.com
    │   |   ├── rpmsnap.2013-02-13_17:00:01.txt
    │   │   ├── rpmsnap.2013-02-19_17:00:01.txt
    │   │   ├── rpmsnap.2013-03-01_17:00:01.err
    │   │   └── rpmsnap.2013-03-01_17:00:01.txt   
    │   └── charlie.example.com
    │       ├── rpmsnap.2013-02-19_17:00:01.err
    │       ├── rpmsnap.2013-02-19_17:00:01.txt
    │       ├── rpmsnap.2013-02-22_17:00:01.txt
    │       └── rpmsnap.2013-02-25_17:00:02.txt
    └── sbin/
        ├── getHostname_function.sh
        ├── makesnap.sh
        ├── prelinkfix.sh
        └── rpmsnap.pl

It is thus easy to check for RPM database differences from any machine.

The summary files "rpmsnap.YYYY-MM-DD_hh:mm:ss.txt" contain long lines like these:

    chkconfig·············1.3.59·············1.fc17···············x86_64···Fedora·Project····:        .........     97  Wed Mar  7 18:43:59 2012

Each lines lists: 

   - package name
   - package version
   - package release
   - package architecture
   - package vendor
   - OR-ed representation of the flags raised on the files of the package during check (SM5DLUGTP)
   - number of files in the package 
   - package build date

As reference, the following flags may be raised when `rpm` compares the actual filesystem state with its
database (from the RPM man page; note that these may differ a bit depending the system issue):

    S : file Size differs
    M : Mode differs (includes permissions and file type)
    5 : MD5 sum differs
    D : Device major/minor number mismatch
    L : readLink(2) path mismatch
    U : User ownership differs
    G : Group ownership differs
    T : mTime differs
    P : caPabilities differ

Ideas and todos
---------------

   - Add the number of missing files to the output.
   - Compare expected package size with effective package size.
   - The rpm database is accessed by calls to `rpm`; but there is actually [RPM4](https://metacpan.org/pod/RPM4)!
   - It might be more productive to dump everything into a relational database and work with that.
   - Would be interesting to examine the provides/requires capability graph, too. So maybe a graph database would be even better.
